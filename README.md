- ``Microsoft SQL Server``
- ``HTML`` & ``CSS``
- ``SyncFusion Components``
- ``Git`` & ``Github``
-  ``Figma``

## ðŸ“– About 

### Description
Finizzi is an application where you can control your spending and consumption in an Izzi way, use the application now and see how your last 7 days were!

### Objective
Learn and practice the following languages and frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework.

### Note
This App is focused in the use of the ASP.NET Core MVC and the Entity Framework, despite its unique and beautiful layout the app is built for large devices, and may not be responsive on many medium and small devices.

## ðŸ”– Layout

You can view the layout of the project through [in here](https://www.figma.com/file/4STnu2DgiYgE4dfyVhLXQQ/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1). You must have an account at [Figma](https://figma.com) to access it. In this case it is just a template layout because it was made after the build was complete.
